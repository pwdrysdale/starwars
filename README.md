# Star Wars API Project

## Description

This is an imperfect project. It's my first go at NextJS13 and React 18 (use 16.8 for work).

Part of the point of the build is to show technical prowess, so I haven't stuck super hard to conventions (or what I know of React 18 conventions), but rather to demonstrate I can build reusable things, but also deviate from it, etc.

Trying to demonstrate clean, maintainable code.

Could probably spend another 10 hours on it, but I think it's a good start.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo, and navigate to the root folder
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev` (requires at least Node 14.8 I think it is)

You can also run `npm run test` to run the tests (there's a small few jest tests)

## Usage

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Start typing to search

## Known Issues

1. Folder structure could probably do with a clean up
2. Not all files follow a capital name convention (Next has lowercase out of the box?)
3. Not all files are in the correct folders (e.g. `components` folder) - some way to go in terms of learning Next conventions

## Proud of

1. I feel like the code is readily extensible
2. I feel like the code is readable maintainable
3. A decent first go at NextJS 13 and React 18, making use of server components and suspense, integrating state management throughout
4. I feel like you could easily reuse components and add pages, like a page for planets, and just reuse many of the components
5. Use of generics, particularly in the reusable store

## Things to improve

1. Fix known issues
2. Learn conventions and implement them
3. Probably some tigher configuration (e.g. enforce return types on functions) - I also noticed that I have different Prettier configs between two computers
4. Could probably tighten the ux a bit

## React 18 / Next JS thoughts

1. A new way of thinking about things, probably harder for newer devs
2. State management has brings up a lot of questions
3. Server components are cool, but I'm not sure how they'll be used in the real world
4. Suspense is really cool
5. Async components are really cool
6. Probably a good move from a high level design perspective

This week I've also been finalizing a loan for a new home, my wife has been unwell, have been showing our current home for sale, running two kids around and working full time. So have been tight for time.
Thanks for reading this far!
